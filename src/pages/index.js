              Hello, and welcome to my personal portfolio! <br />
              My name is Tomas Mac√≠a, and I am a full stack developer based in
              Buenos Aires, Argentina. <br />I am passionate about web
              development and enjoy working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to
              create dynamic and engaging web applications. <br />
              In addition to my front-end skills, I am also proficient in
              node.js, React, Next.js, Chakra UI, and Framer Motion. <br />
              I strive to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and
              trends in web development, and I am always looking for
              opportunities to expand my skillset. <br />
              Aside from my primary stack, I also have some knowledge of Python,
              Selenium, Ubuntu, and Docker. <br />
              I am a quick learner and enjoy taking on new challenges to expand
              my knowledge and abilities. <br />
              I am excited to be a part of the web development community, and I
              look forward to using my skills to create meaningful and impactful
              projects. <br />
              Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio, and please
              feel free to reach out if you have any questions or opportunities
              you would like to discuss. <br />
